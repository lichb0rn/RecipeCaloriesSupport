## About the app

RecipeCalories is an app for tracking your recipes and counting caloried for them.
One of the problems that I encountered while using other applications is the inability to calculate the calorie content of dishes the way I prepare them.
My app solves that problem. You can add the exact amount of ingredients as you cook recipes and then add the results to your favorite calorie tracker.

RecipeCalories does not replace calorie trackers, but complements them.
